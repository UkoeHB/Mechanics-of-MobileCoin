\chapter{{\tt TXTYPE\_RCT\_1} Transaction Structure (WIP)}
\label{appendix:TXTYPE_RCT_1}

We present in this appendix a dump from a real MobileCoin transaction of type {\tt TXTYPE\_RCT\_1}, 
together with explanatory notes for relevant fields.

\if 0 %waiting on in-development app
The dump was obtained from the block explorer \url{https://xmrchain.net}. It can also be acquired by executing command {\tt print\_tx <TransactionID> +hex +json} in the {\tt monerod} daemon run in non-detached mode. {\tt <TransactionID>} is a hash of the transaction (Section \ref{subsec:transaction-id}). The first line printed shows the actual command to run.% see chapter 7 blockchain on TransactionID

To replicate our results, readers can do the following:%\footnote{Blockchain data can also be found with a web block explorer, such as \url{https://moneroblocks.info/} or \url{https://xmrchain.net}.}
\begin{enumerate}
    \item We need the Monero command line tool (CLI), which can be found at \url{https://web.getmonero.org/downloads/} (among other places). Get the `Command Line Tools Only' for your operating system, move the file to a useful location, and unzip it.
    \item Open the terminal/command line and navigate into the folder created by unzipping.
    \item Run {\tt monerod} with {\tt ./monerod}. Now the Monero blockchain will download. Unfortunately, there is currently no easy way to print transactions on your own system (e.g.\ without using a block explorer) without downloading the blockchain.
    \item After the syncing process is done, commands like {\tt print\_tx} will work. Use {\tt help} to learn other commands.
\end{enumerate}
\fi %waiting on in-development app

For editorial reasons we have cut out large parts of the transaction, replacing them with ellipses and noting what was removed. We have also shortened long hexadecimal chains, presenting only the beginning and end as in {\tt b6c346790a841c099d0404da33d07e0dd[...]aa5b0a43b02b}.

Once verified by nodes, all parts of a transaction, aside from components {\tt outputs}, {\tt fee}, and {\tt key\_image}, are discarded. Assuming a given transaction's author doesn't retain a copy, and there are no SGX breaches being exploited, this means the contents of transactions `merged' into the blockchain will be completely lost.
\\

Our sample transaction has 2 inputs and 2 outputs.

\section*{Transaction components}
	
\begin{itemize}
	\item {\tt inputs} (lines 3-66) - List of inputs (there are two here).
	\item {\tt ring} (lines 5-16) - Ring members of the first input. These are outputs copied explicitly from the blockchain record into the transaction structure.
	\item {\tt commitment} (line 8) - Commitment for the first ring member of the first input (Section \ref{sec:ringct-introduction}).
	\item {\tt masked\_value} (line 9) - Field $\textrm{\em masked\_value}_t$, for the first ring member of the first input (Section \ref{sec:pedersen-ringct}).
	\item {\tt target\_key} (line 11) - One-time destination key (address) for the first ring member of the first input (Section \ref{sec:one-time-addresses}).
	\item {\tt public\_key} (line 12) - The transaction output (txout) public key for the first ring member of the first input (Section \ref{sec:one-time-addresses}).
	\item {\tt e\_fog\_hint} (line 13) - Encrypted fog hint for the first ring member of the first input (Section \ref{...}).%[[[revisit with real section ref]]]
	\item {\tt proofs} (lines 17-33) - Membership proofs showing the first ring's members exist in the blockchain (Section \ref{subsec:mobilecoin-membership-proofs}).
	\item {\tt index} (line 19) - Index of the first ring member of the first input (i.e.\ its index within the blockchain record).
	\item {\tt highest\_index} (line 20) - Index of the newest output in the blockchain at the time this membership proof was created. Technically it could be any existing output in the blockchain with index higher than the ring member, but in practice it is likely to be the newest output (at the time the proof was created).
	\item {\tt elements} (lines 21-30) - Membership proof elements, each is a node in the proof's Merkle tree.
	\item {\tt range} (lines 24-25) - Range of elements this proof node represents. Since the {\tt from} and {\tt to} fields are the same, this must be a leaf node.
    \item {\tt hash} (line 27) - The hash value of this proof node.

    \item {\tt outputs} (lines 67-86) - The outputs created by this transaction (there are two). Outputs have the same content fields as ring members, since ring members are just outputs copied from the blockchain.
    \item {\tt fee} (line 87) - Transaction fee in clear text, in this case 0.1 MOB (Section \ref{...}).%[[[revisit with correct section ref where units of MOB are laid out]]]
    \item {\tt tombstone\_block} (line 88) - A future block’s index selected by the transaction author. If this transaction has not been added to the blockchain by the time its tombstone block has been created, then the transaction `dies’ and is no longer eligible for adding to the chain.%[[[revisit... add a section ref from consensus chapter?]]]

    \item {\tt ring\_signatures} (lines 91-148) - MLSAG signatures for the transaction inputs (there are two; Section \ref{subsec:ringct-full-signature}).
    \item {\tt c\_zero} (line 93) - Component \(c_1\) from the first input's MLSAG signature (Section \ref{sec:MLSAG}; note that MobileCoin uses 0-base indexing for MLSAGs, but for consistency/clarify we stick with 1-base indexing).
    \item {\tt responses} (lines 94-117) - In alternating order, components \(r_{i,1}\) and \(r_{i,2}\) from the first input's MLSAG signature\vspace{.175cm}
    \[\sigma_j(\mathfrak{m}) = (c_1, r_{1, 1}, r_{1, 2}, ..., r_{v+1, 1}, r_{v+1, 2})\]
    \item {\tt key\_image} (line 118) - Key image $\tilde{K}_j$ for the first input ($j = 1$; Section \ref{sec:blsag}).

    \item {\tt pseudo\_output\_commitments} (lines 149-152) - Pseudo output commitments $C'^a_j$ for the two inputs (Section  \ref{sec:pedersen-ringct}). Please recall that the sum of these commitments will equal the sum of the two output commitments of this transaction (plus the transaction fee commitment $f H$).
    \item {\tt range\_proofs} (line 153) - Bulletproof proof elements concatenated together into one blob (Bulletproofs were not explored in this document, so we will not itemize further)\vspace{.175cm}
    \[\Pi_{BP} = (A, S, T_1, T_2, t_x, t^{blinding}_x, e^{blinding}, \mathbb{L}, \mathbb{R}, a, b)\]

\chapter{Block Content (WIP)}
\label{appendix:block-content}

In this appendix we show the structure of a sample block from the testnet, namely the 42\nd block after the origin block. The block has three outputs and one key image. We can infer this block was created from one transaction with one input and two outputs, since all transactions must have an input (but there is only one key image), and one output from every block must be for the block fee.%[[[revisit to clarify about testnet, or to replace this block with a mainnet transaction]]]

\section*{Block components (WIP)}

\if 0
\begin{itemize}
	\item (lines 2-10) - Block information collected by software, not actually part of the block properly speaking.
    \item {\tt is orphan} (line 5) - Signifies if this block was orphaned. Nodes usually store all branches during a fork situation, and discard unnecessary branches when a cumulative difficulty winner emerges, thereby orphaning the blocks.
    \item {\tt depth} (line 7) - In a blockchain copy, the depth of any given block is how far back in the chain it is relative to the most recent block.
    \item {\tt hash} (line 8) - This block's block ID.
    \item {\tt difficulty} (line 9) - Difficulty isn't stored in a block, since users can compute {\em all} block difficulties from block timestamps and the rules in Section \ref{sec:difficulty}.
    \item {\tt major\_version} (line 12) - Corresponds to the protocol version used to verify this block.
    \item {\tt minor\_version} (line 13) - Originally intended as a voting mechanism among miners, it now merely reiterates the {\tt major\_version}. Since the field does not occupy much space, the developers probably thought deprecating it would not be worth the effort.
    \item {\tt timestamp} (line 14) - An integer representation of this block's UTC timestamp, as reported by the block's miner.
    \item {\tt prev\_id} (line 15) - The previous block's block ID. Herein lies the essence of Monero's blockchain.
    \item {\tt nonce} (line 16) - The nonce used by this block's miner to pass its difficulty target. Anyone can recompute the proof of work and verify the nonce is valid.
    \item {\tt miner\_tx} (lines 17-40) - This block's miner transaction.
    \item {\tt version} (line 18) - Transaction format/era version; `2' corresponds to RingCT.
    \item {\tt unlock\_time} (line 19) - The miner transaction's output can't be spent until the 1582256\nth block, after 59 more blocks have been mined (it is a 60 block lock time since it can't be spent until 60 block time intervals have passed, e.g.\ $2*60 = 120$ minutes).
    \item {\tt vin} (lines 20-25) - Inputs to the miner tx. There are none, since the miner tx is used to generate block rewards and collect transaction fees.
    \item {\tt gen} (line 21) - Short for `generate'.
    \item {\tt height} (line 22) - The block height for which this miner tx's block reward was generated. Each block height can only generate a block reward once.
    \item {\tt vout} (lines 26-32) - Outputs of the miner tx.
    \item {\tt amount} (line 27) - Amount dispersed by the miner tx, containing block reward and fees from this block's transactions. Recorded in atomic units.
    \item {\tt key} (line 29) - One-time address assigning ownership of the miner tx's amount.
    \item {\tt extra} (lines 33-36) - Extra information for the miner tx, including the transaction public key.
    \item {\tt type} (line 38) - Type of transaction, in this case `0' for {\tt RCTTypeNull}, indicating a miner tx.
    \item {\tt tx\_hashes} (lines 41-46) - All transaction IDs included in this block (but not the miner tx ID, which is {\tt 06fb3e1cf889bb972774a8535208d98db164394ef2b14ecfe74814170557e6e9}).

\chapter{Origin Block (WIP)}
\label{appendix:origin-block}

\if 0
In this appendix we show the structure of a MobileCoin testnet origin block. The block has 0 transactions (it just sends the first block reward to thankful\_for\_today \cite{bitmonero-launched}). Monero's founder did not add a timestamp, perhaps as a relic of Bytecoin, the coin Monero's code was forked from, whose creators apparently tried to hide a large pre-mine \cite{monero-history}, and may operate a shady network of cryptocurrency-related software and services \cite{bytecoin-network}.

Block 1 was added to the blockchain at timestamp 2014-04-18 10:49:53 UTC (as reported by the block's miner), so we can assume the genesis block was created the same day. This corresponds with the launch date announced by thankful\_for\_today \cite{bitmonero-launched}.

\section*{Genesis block components}

Since we used the same software to print the genesis block and the block from Appendix \ref{appendix:block-content}, the structure appears basically the same. We point out some unique differences.

\begin{itemize}
	\item {\tt difficulty} (line 9) - The genesis block's difficulty is reported as 1, which means any nonce could work.
	\item {\tt timestamp} (line 14) - The genesis block doesn't have a meaningful timestamp.
	\item {\tt prev\_id} (line 15) - We use an empty 32 bytes for the previous ID, by convention.
	\item {\tt nonce} (line 16) - $n = 10000$ by convention.
	\item {\tt amount} (line 27) - This exactly corresponds to our calculation for the first block reward (17.592186044415 XMR) in Section \ref{subsec:block-reward}.
	\item {\tt key} (line 29) - The very first Moneroj were dispersed to Monero's founder thankful\_for\_today.
	\item {\tt extra} (lines 33-36) - Using the encoding discussed in Appendix \ref{appendix:RCTTypeBulletproof2}, the genesis block's miner tx {\tt extra} field just contains one transaction public key.
	\item {\tt signatures} (line 37) - There are no signatures in the genesis block. This is here as an artifact of the {\tt print\_block} function. The same is true for {\tt tx\_hashes} in line 39.
\end{itemize}
